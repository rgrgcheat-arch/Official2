RENDER DEPLOY
1. Upload all these files to a GitHub repo.
2. Render > New > Web Service > connect repo (runtime Python).
   Build: pip install -r requirements.txt
   Start: gunicorn app:app --workers 1 --threads 32 --timeout 120 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
3. Environment variables: ADMIN_USER, ADMIN_PASS, SECRET_KEY
4. Admin: https://YOUR-APP.onrender.com/admin   Reseller: /login
Keep-alive: automatic (uses RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL, pings /health every 10 min).

ADMIN LOGIN
Admin login is fixed in app.py (ADMIN_USER / ADMIN_PASS at the top). Change it there when ready.

KEYS PER PLAN (Admin > Products)
- Manual keys : add keys (one per line) with the "Keys" button; view / edit / delete them there.
- External API: "API" button -> URL, method, headers, body, key location in response.
- Auto-generate: random key (old behaviour).

---- v4 ----
LOGIN: one login page (/login, /admin/login both work). Admin credentials -> Admin panel. Reseller credentials -> Reseller panel.
MAIN API: Admin > Main API  -> paste Base URL + API Token -> "Save & Connect" (shows Connected + balance). "Check Balance" refreshes it.
ALL PRODUCTS: Admin > Main API > All Products -> select (or Import ALL). Plans + INR prices are created automatically.
  Optional markup %. Edit selling prices any time in Admin > Products. Purchases are bought live from the main API.
BACKUP: Admin > Backup -> Download Backup (json, goes to Downloads). Upload it again to restore everything.
  IMPORTANT: Render free disk is wiped on every redeploy/restart -> download a backup after changes, restore after redeploy.

---- v5 ----
KEY GENERATOR: pick product -> validity (plan + price) -> quantity (- / +) -> Generate Keys. Keys are made one by one (no timeout) and shown in a copy box.
KEY HISTORY: search, SRC column (API / PANEL), copy button beside each time, "Plaintext keys" box with Last N (only sizes you really have) / All, Copy all, Download .txt.
ADD BALANCE (UPI): fixed amounts 200/500/1000/1500/2000/2500 -> QR -> auto verification (also 5 min in background) -> balance credited once.
  Admin > Gateway: enter Gateway URL (default https://fampaygateway.site), your UPI ID and API token, then "Generate test QR".
BROADCAST: Admin > Broadcast (one reseller or all). Resellers see it in sidebar > Broadcast (new-notice badge).
COLOUR: palette button (top right) - saved per reseller, also applied on the login page.
MUSIC: after reopening, the same song restarts from its beginning; backup now includes uploaded songs (backup file gets bigger).

---- v6 ----
TELEGRAM BOT (runs inside the website - tgbot.py, no separate hosting)
  1. The bot token is set in Admin > Telegram (never in the code).
  2. Open your bot in Telegram and send:  /admin 909090   (your admin password) -> you become the admin. Nothing else to set.
  3. Reseller opens the bot, presses Start, sends you his Chat ID -> Admin > Resellers (create form or Manage).
LOGIN: username + password -> (new device: admin gets Accept/Reject in Telegram) -> 6-digit code in Telegram -> dashboard.
  Reseller > Security: login code ON/OFF, alerts, low-balance limit, own devices. Rejected device sees only a red ACCESS BLOCKED page.
  Admin > Devices: accept / reject / remove any device.
ALERTS: NEW PURCHASE ALERT (panel + API), LOW BALANCE ALERT, BALANCE ADDED.
ADD BALANCE AMOUNTS: Admin > Gateway > "Add-balance amounts" (e.g. 100, 300, 500).
BACKUP: music now has its OWN backup (Admin > Backup > Music Backup .zip). The normal backup no longer contains music.

---- v7 ----
LOGIN CODE (Telegram): every login makes a NEW random 6-digit code and sends it to the reseller's Telegram.
  Wrong code / too many tries = never reaches the dashboard. Right code = dashboard. A code works only once, for 5 minutes.
  The code is now sent immediately, and if Telegram refuses, the REAL reason is shown on the verification page
  (e.g. "Chat ID is wrong, or that person never pressed START in the bot") instead of failing silently.
  The verification page shows the last 4 digits of the Chat ID the code was sent to.
MASTER SWITCH: Admin > Telegram > "Login code for resellers" (untick = nobody needs a code until the bot works).
  Per reseller: Admin > Resellers > Manage > Login code ON/OFF (or the reseller's own Security page).
LINKING EXISTING RESELLERS: Admin > Resellers: every "Not linked" reseller has a Chat ID box + Link button.
  Everybody who pressed /start in the bot is listed, so you can tap the name (Manage page) or pick the ID.
  Saving a Chat ID sends a test message at once and tells you if it was really delivered.
DELIVERY LOG: Admin > Telegram shows the last sends (Delivered / Failed + exact reason), per-reseller Test buttons,
  and warns if another copy of the bot (same token) is running somewhere else.
PURCHASE ALERT: product, quantity, wallet balance left, validity, amount paid, TIME, key issued.
LOW BALANCE ALERT: sent after every purchase while the balance is under the reseller's limit (default 50).

---- v8 (freeze fix) ----
Login no longer waits for Telegram: the code is sent in the background and the verification page shows
"Sending... / Code delivered / Could not send: <reason>" live. If Telegram is slow the page still opens at once.
Telegram connections are forced to IPv4 (broken IPv6 routes can make requests hang on Render) and have short timeouts.
Failed Telegram sends are also printed to the Render > Logs tab as "[telegram] FAILED ...".

---- v9 (alerts) ----
Every Telegram message is now sent from its own background thread (no shared queue that could stall).
Alerts show money in INR (e.g. "59 INR"). Purchase alert: product, quantity, wallet balance, validity, paid, time, key.
If an alert is NOT sent, the reason is written to Admin > Telegram > Delivery log
(e.g. "skipped: no Telegram Chat ID linked", "skipped: reseller turned alerts OFF", or the Telegram error).
Reseller > Security > "Send me a test alert" sends a sample purchase alert at once.

---- v10.1 ----
ADMIN > SOLD KEYS: new card layout (no broken keys). Key is in its own box, tap the key or press Copy. Search, Active/Expired filter, "Copy shown keys".
BOT / API CONNECT (Reseller > API & Docs): reseller gives his bot the Server URL (your Render link) + API Token.
  GET  /api/v1/connect   -> "Connect successful" (connected:true) or "Not connected" (401, connected:false)
  GET  /api/v1/balance   -> wallet balance
  GET  /api/v1/products  -> ALL products with plans + the reseller's prices;  ?ids=1,4,7 (or POST {"product_ids":[..]}) -> only selected
  POST /api/v1/purchase  -> {"plan_id": N} returns the key
  Token can be sent as X-API-Key, Authorization: Bearer, or ?api_key=. CORS is open for /api/v1 (token based).
  API & Docs page has: 4-step guide, copy buttons, a Connection tester (Connect / Check balance / Select products), Python helper for bots, cURL.
RESELLER > SETTINGS (above Logout): change password with current password (or generate a strong one). All other logged-in browsers are logged out,
  Telegram gets a "PASSWORD CHANGED" alert, optional new API key, 5 wrong tries = 10 min lock. New devices still need admin approval.

---- v10.2 ----
FIXES: Telegram calls can no longer freeze the site (hard 5-16 s deadline on every Telegram request; test buttons wait max 7 s; Admin > Telegram page opens at once).
  Admin > Telegram now says "Cannot reach Telegram: ..." with the real reason if the server cannot reach Telegram.
ADMIN HOME: "Keys Sold" showed <built-in method keys ...> - fixed.
RESELLER BALANCE: Admin > Resellers > Manage > "Add / Deduct Balance" has separate Add and Deduct buttons (balance never goes below 0).
MUSIC: upload shows a progress bar; reseller panel no longer pre-downloads songs on every page.
RENDER: set Start Command to  gunicorn app:app --workers 1 --threads 32 --timeout 120 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT

---- v10.3 (admin alerts) ----
ADMIN LOGIN ALERT: every successful reseller login sends the admin a Telegram "RESELLER LOGIN" (name, device, IP, time, balance).
ADMIN PURCHASE ALERT: every purchase (panel + API) sends the admin the same NEW PURCHASE ALERT, plus at the bottom
  "Bought by: <reseller name>" and "Reseller Current Balance". Admin copy is sent even if the reseller has no Chat ID or alerts OFF.

---- v10.5 ----
BOT TOKEN: set in Admin > Telegram (see v10.7).
  (If /start shows another channel's "must join" message, the same token is running somewhere else - revoking the token stops that copy.)
BALANCE ADDED: every top-up (auto UPI or Admin > Reseller > add balance) sends YOU: reseller name, amount added, current balance, method, time.
  The reseller also gets "BALANCE ADDED" (if his alerts are on).
PREMIUM EMOJI: packs RGCHEAT99, botd3, NewsEmoji (change with env EMOJI_PACKS=a,b,c; first pack wins) are loaded from Telegram at start.
  Every normal emoji in bot messages becomes its premium twin automatically; inline buttons get premium icons.
  If Telegram refuses (text emoji need a Fragment username on the bot), the bot falls back to normal emoji by itself - nothing is lost.
  Admin > Telegram > Premium emoji shows status + on/off switch. In the bot (as admin): /emojis = status; send premium emojis or a t.me/addemoji link = get IDs.

---- v10.7 ----
BOT TOKEN IS NO LONGER IN THE CODE: app.py has no token any more, so a GitHub leak cannot expose it.
  Admin > Telegram > paste token > Save. It is checked with Telegram first, then the bot switches to it at once (no redeploy).
  Token leaked? @BotFather /revoke -> paste the new token in Admin > Telegram. Website stays online.
  Priority: token saved in the panel > Render env TG_BOT_TOKEN (optional fallback). The token is part of the normal Backup (settings).
  NOTE: Render free disk is wiped on redeploy -> restore the backup, or set env TG_BOT_TOKEN once as a safety net.
PREMIUM EMOJI: if a pack has no twin for an emoji, the closest one is used (e.g. money bag -> dollar note).
  Admin > Telegram > Premium emoji picker: tap a normal emoji, tap the premium one you like -> used in ALL messages at once.
  "Send sample purchase alert" shows the result in your Telegram. Approve/Reject button text also gets the premium icon.

---- v10.8 (emoji ID manager) ----
Admin > Telegram > "Emoji ID manager": every emoji the bot uses has its own ID box. Paste a premium emoji ID -> Save -> used in ALL messages at once
  (text + button icons). Empty the box + Save = back to automatic. A small preview shows the emoji; Telegram is asked if the ID exists (typo warning).
ADD ANY EMOJI: type any normal emoji + its premium ID -> Add. Works for every emoji that appears in a bot message. Remove button to delete it.
PASTE MANY: one line per emoji ("<emoji> <ID>"), exactly like the bot's /emojis / premium-emoji reply -> Apply all.
GET AN ID: as admin, send any premium emoji (or a t.me/addemoji/... link) to the bot -> it replies with the ID of every emoji.
  IDs from ANY pack work now (they do not have to be in EMOJI_PACKS). Choices are saved in the backup (settings).

---- v10.11 (BOT MAKE) ----
RESELLER: left three-line menu > "Bot Make" (above Security). Fill 3 boxes: Bot name, Bot API token (@BotFather), Admin ID -> the bot is created and started at once.
  The bot name is used everywhere inside the bot, the token is linked, the typed Admin ID becomes the bot's admin. Your own admin ID
  (Admin > Telegram > admin Chat ID) is ALWAYS added too and cannot be removed inside the bot. One bot per reseller.
ADMIN: three-line menu > "Bots": see every reseller bot (name, @username, reseller, admin ID, Running/Stopped), Stop / Start / Restart / Delete,
  Log (last lines of the bot's output), Database download, "Add / restore database" (upload .db or .zip - old DB is kept as safety copy, bot restarts),
  Max bots limit, "Backup all bots (.zip)" + Restore (Render free disk is wiped on redeploy - restore brings every bot and its database back).
FILES: bot_main.py = the bot code (next to app.py - do NOT put it in a folder) (copied into every created bot on each start). To update ALL bots: replace this file and redeploy.
  Each bot lives in data/bot_instances/<id>/ with its OWN shop_data.db. A watchdog restarts crashed bots and starts every bot again after the website restarts.
RENDER: keep  gunicorn app:app --workers 1 --threads 32 ...  (one worker, because it manages the bot processes). Every bot is one extra Python process
  (memory!). On the free 512 MB plan keep "Max bots" small (2-3) or use a paid plan.

---- v11 (users + new main API + logo + light/dark) ----
USERS: login page has "CREATE NEW ACCOUNT" (username + password + confirm). Users log in with username + password only
  (no device approval, no Telegram code). Users see the USER price; resellers see the RESELLER price. Users do not get
  Security / API & Docs / Bot Make. Admin > Resellers / Users (tabs) manages both; Admin > Logo & Theme can close sign-ups.
MAIN API (old adminshops API removed): Admin > Main API > Server URL + API Token -> "Save & Connect" (Connect successful + balance).
  Admin > Main API > All Products: tick products/plans (or Select all / Import ALL). Prices: reseller = cost +50%, user = cost +200%
  (both % can be changed on that page; "Sync prices" re-prices everything imported). Plans are bought live (POST /api/v1/purchase).
  Plans imported from the OLD api are hidden and cannot be bought - delete them in Admin > Products and import again.
LOGO: Admin > Logo & Theme: add / replace / remove the picture shown in the menu, login page and dashboard.
LIGHT / DARK: sun/moon button at the top of every page (saved per browser). Admin sets the default look.

---- v12 (part 1: name + admin security + users section) ----
NAME: OFFICIAL SELLER everywhere (panel, bot messages, bot_main). Admin login: NOVIX / 909090.
ADMIN SECURITY: the admin password alone no longer opens the panel.
  First login (no bot token saved yet): username + password -> "Connect your bot" page -> paste the bot API token (checked with Telegram)
  + admin Chat ID (default is already filled) -> a 6-digit code is sent to that chat -> enter it -> panel.
  EVERY later login: username + password -> NEW 6-digit code in the admin Telegram chat (5 min, one use) -> panel. Cannot be switched off.
  Admin session ends after 8 hours. Wrong codes / too many codes are rate-limited. Admin gets an "ADMIN LOGIN" alert after each login.
  The bot token cannot be removed from the panel (only replaced). The /admin <password> bot command works only until the first verified admin login.
  Session key is no longer derived from the admin password (random key saved in data/.secret_key, or env SECRET_KEY).
ADMIN CHAT ID CHANGE: Admin > Telegram > "Admin Chat ID": type the new ID -> a code goes to the NEW chat -> type it -> saved. Old chat is notified. No code edit needed.
USERS: separate admin menu item "Users" (never mixed into Resellers). Tabs Active / Banned / Deleted + search.
  Ban / Unban, Delete (soft, can be restored), Restore, Delete forever (only from the Deleted tab). Same buttons for resellers.
  Banned / deleted accounts cannot login and their API token stops working.
NEXT (part 2): Paytm gateway + Fampay toggle + simple QR, product logo / premium emoji, "Reseller Update" for users.

---- v12 (part 2: Paytm gateway, QR, product icons, Reseller Update) ----
GATEWAY TOGGLE: Admin > Gateway > "Active gateway": Fampay / Paytm. Paytm ON = Fampay OFF, Paytm OFF = Fampay ON. Only the active one creates new QR codes
  (payments already created on the other one still finish). Paytm = ZYVO PAY API (https://zyvopay.site/api).
PAYTM SETUP: Admin > Gateway > Paytm: paste the API key (public.secret) + webhook secret -> Save -> "Generate Paytm test QR" (Rs.1, never credited) -> switch Paytm ON.
  (or Render env ZYVOPAY_API_KEY / ZYVOPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET / ZYVOPAY_BASE_URL). The key/secret are never shown again, never put in a page or log.
  Requests are signed on the server: HMAC-SHA256(secret, timestamp + "." + exact JSON body). Paid only when the signed check says "successful"
  and reference, order id, INR and the exact amount match. Credit happens once (safe against duplicates).
  WEBHOOK: set  https://YOUR-SITE/zyvo/webhook  in the Paytm dashboard (signature header X-ZyvoPay-Signature is verified; bad signature = 401; duplicates ignored).
QR: simple black/white QR, same look for both gateways. Paytm QR is made on the server from the exact payment_uri (instant, no outside QR service).
  The payment page opens at once (no gateway call while loading) and checks the payment every 3 seconds. "Open UPI App" shows only if the gateway allows it.
PRODUCT LOGO / EMOJI: Admin > Products > "Logo / premium emoji" on each product: upload a small picture and/or paste a Telegram premium emoji ID.
  Shown next to the product name in Admin > Products and in the Generate Key page.
RESELLER UPDATE: Admin > Gateway > set "Reseller Update price" (0 = closed). Users see "Reseller Update" in the left menu -> pay -> verified -> the account becomes a
  RESELLER at once (reseller prices, API & Docs, Bot Make), balance and history stay, admin gets a "RESELLER UPDATE" alert.
  Admin can also press "Make Reseller" on a user's Manage page.

---- v13 ----
BACKGROUND PICTURE: Admin > Logo & Theme > "Background picture" -> choose image -> Add background. Shows on every page (login, dashboard, admin).
  Darkness (Light / Medium / Strong) keeps the text readable. "Remove background" brings the normal look back.
PAYTM (ZYVO PAY): Admin > Gateway > Paytm: enter UPI ID + API Token -> "Save & connect Paytm". A Rs.1 test QR is made automatically;
  if it works, Paytm turns ON by itself. Webhook secret / API URL are optional (Advanced).
PRODUCT LOGO: Admin > Products > "Logo / premium emoji" under each product (picture upload or Telegram emoji ID). Shown as small chips on the Generate page.
NO BALANCE: Generate Keys with too little balance now opens a popup with an "Add balance" button.
